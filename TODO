* add express to process
* add API
* add mongo usage (we can store the generated list in mongo and retrieve?)


ok so like my idea is the user inputs the different types of stuff they might want, selects that and the posts the form

From the stuff selected, we randomly generate like 10 different combinations that are stored in mongodb 
Each card entry is showed back to the user in tinder form with cards
[we can have a user id associated with each "card" in mongo]

Each "card" represents a boba combination and the affinity score (we use the API to generate):
* tea 
* toppings
* picture? random cute one ig
* affinity score
